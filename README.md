I created This adventure-style maze game with a team during my first semester at The Ohio State University! It was originally made with MATLAB, but I remade it using Python! In addition, I added AI enemies, a new scoring system, and a level system! The classic game, Pacman inspired this project! 

This project is still a work in progress as there are some game aspects I would like to add and change, but it is still fully functional!
